QT:
- detect what lang-packas-{kde,gnome} needs to be installed
- add LanguageSelectorPkgCache.canInstall() to check during the click
- move the error detection into generic code

<sabdfl> mvo: there is a nice "mostly" status on a checkbox, that I think is your friend here
<sabdfl> so when someone checks that, you try to install the packages
<mvo> sabdfl: the inconsitent state? ok, I'll use this
<sabdfl> if you don't have all of them, the status becomes "mostly"
<mvo> ok
<sabdfl> if you get all of it, then its checked
<sabdfl> we need to figure out how to prompt for additional packages after install
<sabdfl> have you worked with mdz on that?
<sabdfl> i think a text file of needed packages would work
<sabdfl> along with an update to the notifier that it checks there, and tells the user on login
<sabdfl> that way, if the additional bits are not on the CD, or on a special archive the user provides, then the user will get prompted to try and install them when they can
<sabdfl> if the user gets updates normally and the packages are available they should just be installed, no questions
<Kamion> happy to make the installer integrate with any such facility; shouldn't be hard
<sabdfl> no special questions
<sabdfl> Kamion: cool

* speed:
  - currently _missingTranslationPkgs() is called too often and that means
    and it iterates over the entire cache too often. it should be changed
    so that it only goes over the cache *once* by changing it so that it
    gets a list of translations we are interessted in
* i18n:
  - interface  
  - all language names
* make it more user friendly:
  - add a "preview" when pressing "ok"
  - add a message then the system is completed that you
    need to login/logout
